A fully implementation of Rijndael encryption in pure Python.

![Index](rijndael.png)

# Usage
First install rijndael from PyPi
```bash
    pip install rijndael
```
and now you can use encryption/decryption system.
```python
    from rijndael.cipher.crypt import new
    from rijndael.cipher.blockcipher import MODE_CBC
    
    rjn = new(KEY, MODE_CBC, IV, blocksize=BLOCKSIZE)
    encd = rjn.encrypt('A padded string to BLOCKSIZE length.')

    rjn = new(KEY, MODE_CBC, IV, blocksize=BLOCKSIZE)
    decd = rjn.decrypt('A padded string to BLOCKSIZE length.')
```


# Chaining Modes
```rijndael``` supports multiple chaining modes.
* Right now these chaining modes are supported:
    * MODE_ECB
    * MODE_CBC
    * MODE_CFB
    * MODE_OFB
    * MODE_CTR
    * MODE_XTS
    * MODE_CMAC
